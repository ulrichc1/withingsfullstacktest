If I had more time (like 6 hours to do the whole project), I could have done a clean and working code for the frontend project (Trivia Quizz).

The Backend project took me a lot of time (1h30) which made me lost a whole hour to complete the React project.

I would have also minified the code in order to improve the performance of the application.

Finally, I had some issues with yarn, so the front-end project is in the '/frontendquiz' folder (installed with npm).
